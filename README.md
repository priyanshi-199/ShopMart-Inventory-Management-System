It facilitates various tasks including item addition, removal, and search functionalities based on IDs, alongside stock level and expiry date monitoring. Additionally, the system provides order recommendations for items with low stock and alerts for items nearing expiry. Developed in C, it effectively handles intricate inventory data and offers a user-friendly interface for functions like order recommendations, item inquiries, and expiry monitoring. Furthermore, it incorporates billing and frequency tracking features to assist in restocking decisions. Notably, the system also analyzes purchase patterns to identify frequently bought together items, aiding store owners in promoting itemsÂ effectively.
